# Rainbow-OS

## What is rainbow? 
It is an experimental Operating System coded in rust from zero. Rust is now thought as a next-generation programming language. It is fast, small and c-like. In this small project, I am not aiming at growing a full-stack OS which was a resource consuming job. My goal is experimenting, demostration and inspiration. And I always believe that small is beautiful.

Is it cool? Is it a crazy project? No, it will be full of fun. So let us wait and see.

It is not only an open source project, but also a birthday gift. Good luck to me, and to the one who I am loving.
